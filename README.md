# yorkuthesis

This template is adapted from the sfuthesis project and was modified in 2025 by Michael Palumbo to meet the dissertation formatting requirements of York University for a Complex/Multimodal Thesis Type Dissertation within the Department of Digital Media.

The LaTeX class file yorku.cls defines the document style and formatting.

For the most up-to-date requirements on formatting and required components, please consult the York University Graduate Studies guidelines:

Additional instructions and advice are provided in the comments at the beginning of both thesis.tex and yorku.cls. This template also includes sample excerpts, drawn from Michael's dissertation, to demonstrate how to create and format tables, figures, and references to appendices.
